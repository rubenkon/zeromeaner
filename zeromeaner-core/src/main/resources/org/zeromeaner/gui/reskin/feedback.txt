Feedback in the issue tracker is the absolute best way to improve zeromeaner.  Be it a bug report, a feature request, or even a complaint (ESPECIALLY a complaint!), I want to hear it.  Don't worry about submitting duplicate issues; I can sort out duplicates, and if something gets submitted more than once that tells me it's something I need to focus on.

Seriously, this issue tracker is the lifeblood of zeromeaner development.

PS: Please include the version of zeromeaner in your feedback.  If you are playing a -SNAPSHOT version, it would also be helpful to include the revision.
